# DHL Invoice Audit Application

A comprehensive Python Flask web application for auditing DHL shipping invoices by parsing EDI files and performing detailed cost analysis against rate cards.

## ðŸš€ Features

### Core Functionality
- **EDI File Processing**: Parse X12 EDI format files (210, 214 transaction sets)
- **Invoice Data Extraction**: Extract shipping details, charges, and metadata
- **Rate Card Matching**: Intelligent matching of invoices to negotiated rate cards
- **Detailed Audit Analysis**: Line-by-line charge comparison with variance analysis
- **Multi-Modal Support**: Air freight and Ocean freight (FCL/LCL) auditing
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Advanced city/port matching for rate card selection

### Transportation Modes
- **Air Freight**: Weight-based pricing with handling fees and surcharges
- **Ocean Freight**: Container-based pricing (20ft/40ft FCL) with detailed breakdown
- **LCL (Less Container Load)**: Volume-based pricing with minimum charges

### Audit Intelligence
- **Undercharge Logic**: Automatically passes invoices with favorable pricing
- **Variance Thresholds**: Configurable tolerance levels for cost differences
- **Status Classification**: PASS/WARNING/FAIL with detailed explanations
- **Rate Card Scoring**: Best match selection based on route accuracy
- **Export Functionality**: Export audit results to CSV/Excel

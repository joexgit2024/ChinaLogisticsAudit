RATE CARD STRUCTURE UPDATE SUMMARY
=================================

Date: August 2, 2025

ISSUE RESOLVED:
- Fixed "no such column: zone_12" errors in audit engine
- DHL Express rate cards table now supports both Export (9 zones) and Import (19 zones)

CHANGES MADE:

1. DATABASE TABLE STRUCTURE:
   - Updated dhl_express_rate_cards table to include zones 1-19 (was zones 1-9)
   - Cleared all existing rate card data
   - Added proper indexes for performance

2. RATE CARD LOADER UPDATES:
   File: improved_dhl_express_rate_card_loader.py
   - Modified init_rate_card_table() to create 19 zone columns
   - Updated _load_documents_section() to read appropriate zones per service type
   - Updated _load_non_documents_section_improved() with dynamic zone reading
   - Updated _load_multiplier_section_improved() with dynamic zone reading
   - Added logic: Export uses zones 1-9, Import uses zones 1-19
   - All unused zones are padded with NULL values

3. SERVICE TYPE SUPPORT:
   - Export Rate Cards: Uses zones 1-9 (columns zone_1 to zone_9)
   - Import Rate Cards: Uses zones 1-19 (columns zone_1 to zone_19)
   - Database supports both with same table structure

4. AUDIT ENGINE COMPATIBILITY:
   - No changes needed - already uses dynamic zone column names
   - Will automatically work with zones 10-19 now that columns exist

NEXT STEPS:
1. Upload your Export rate card file (will populate zones 1-9)
2. Upload your Import rate card file (will populate zones 1-19)
3. Test the batch audit functionality
4. Verify no more "zone_12" errors occur

TABLE STRUCTURE NOW:
- id, service_type, rate_section, weight_from, weight_to
- zone_1, zone_2, zone_3, zone_4, zone_5, zone_6, zone_7, zone_8, zone_9
- zone_10, zone_11, zone_12, zone_13, zone_14, zone_15, zone_16, zone_17, zone_18, zone_19
- is_multiplier, weight_range_from, weight_range_to, created_timestamp

âœ… System is now ready for rate card uploads!

# Enhanced Invoice Extraction Implementation

## What Was Implemented

1. **Adopting Llama 3.2 as Primary Extraction Model**
   - Updated `SchemaDrivenLLMProcessor` to use "llama3.2:latest" as the default model
   - Added a dedicated API route for switching between models (`model_api_routes.py`)
   - Enhanced prompt template with better examples including D2133868

2. **Schema-Guided Extraction with Explicit Format Examples**
   - Enhanced the structured prompt with more detailed examples and classification rules
   - Added a third example from D2133868 that shows GST handling and surcharges
   - Improved the extraction guidelines with more specific category mappings

3. **Comprehensive Validation Rules**
   - Implemented detailed validation for extraction results
   - Added validation for: 
     - Invoice number format
     - Date formats with automatic correction
     - Currency validation
     - Reasonableness checks for amounts
     - Totals consistency between line items and invoice total
     - Required field presence
   - Added confidence score calculation based on data quality
   - Generated detailed processing notes for audit trail

4. **Batch Reprocessing for Incomplete Extractions**
   - Created `batch_reprocess_invoices.py` to identify and reprocess incomplete extractions
   - Created `run_batch_reprocess.py` as a command-line script for easy execution
   - Implemented detailed logging and CSV export of reprocessing results
   - Added tracking of improvement metrics between old and new extractions

## How to Use

### Switching to Llama 3.2 for New Extractions

All new extractions will automatically use Llama 3.2 since it's now the default model. The model can be changed via the API:

```
POST /api/switch-default-model
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "model": "llama3.2:latest"
}
```

### Reprocessing Incomplete Extractions

To reprocess incomplete or low-confidence extractions:

1. Run the batch reprocessing script:

```
python run_batch_reprocess.py --threshold 0.7 --limit 10
```

Options:
- `--threshold`: Confidence threshold (default: 0.7)
- `--limit`: Limit number of invoices to process (optional)
- `--db`: Database path (default: dhl_audit.db)

### Viewing Validation Results

Validation results are saved to the database and can be viewed in the extraction details page. Look for:

- Confidence score
- Processing notes with any issues detected
- Manual review flag for extractions that need human verification

## Architecture Changes

1. **Model Management**: Added model switching API for flexibility
2. **Enhanced Validation**: Comprehensive validation integrated into extraction pipeline
3. **Schema Example Update**: More robust examples for better extraction quality
4. **Batch Processing**: Scalable batch reprocessing for historical data

## Testing and Validation

The implementation was tested with invoice D2133868 which showed significant improvement with Llama 3.2 over previous models.

Key metrics:
- Improved extraction accuracy for line items
- Better category classification
- Proper handling of GST amounts
- More complete extraction of invoice summary fields

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Extraction Quality**: Track confidence scores and manual review flags
2. **Fine-tune Validation Rules**: Adjust thresholds based on real-world results
3. **Expand Prompt Examples**: Add more examples for unusual invoice formats
4. **Create UI for Model Selection**: Add frontend controls for model switching
